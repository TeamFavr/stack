# Stack

This contains a stable copy of all services which all work together.

You will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To start everything run: `docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up -d` then you can access the [REST API](https://github.com/TeamFavr/restapi-service) on localhost:5000
